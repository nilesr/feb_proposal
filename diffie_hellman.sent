Encryption without shared secrets

Diffie-Hellman

We want to send encrypted messages

I decide to generate a random password

The password I generate is "cfzpz"

Alice does not know this password, so
    if I encrypt a message with this password
    and send it, Alice won't be able to understand it

I need to send Alice the password
Without Eva knowing it

Example 1

@wikipedia_diffie_hellman.png

#@box.png
#TODO

#@locker_lock.png
#TODO

Example 2

If I send you the box with my lock on it

You put your own lock on the box and send it back

I take my lock off, so now it only has your lock
    and send it back

You take your lock off and now you can open it

It was sent through the mail three times

Each time it had a lock on it

Eva can never open the box

Example 3

I convert each letter to it's number
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc..

Password is now 3, 6, 26, 16, 26

m = 3

I generate a very large random number and don't tell anyone what it is

This large random number is a

I multiply the message by the number to get m*a

I send Alice this number

Alice generates a very large random number (b) and doesn't tell anyone what it is

Alice multiplies what I sent her by b and sends it back

m*a*b

I divide what she sends me by my number, a, to get m*b

I send back the result of that, m*b

Alice divides what I sent her by her number (b) to get m

Alice now knows m is 3

Repeat for the rest of the leters in the encryptopn key

Don't do that

This is very insecure

Eva knows what m*a, m*b and m*a*b are

Eva can compute (m*a)(m*b)/(m*a*b) to get m.

In the real world, this isn't used

Example 4

How it's really done

Modulo

What is 10/25

It's 2

To a computer, 10/25 is 2 because 10 goes into 25 two times

We know it as two remainder five

The modulo operator (%) gets the remainder

In the mind of a computer
10/25 = 2
10%25 = 5

Back to Diffie-Hellman

You tell Alice to use modulus 23 and base 5

23 is randomly generated

5 a is primitave root modulo 23

You generate a random number that you don't tell anyone

It's 6

Alice generates a random number that she doesn't tell anyone

It's 15

You calculate and send
5 to the power of your secret number (6) modulo 23
8

Alice calculates and sends
5 to the power of her secret number (15) modulo 23
19

Bob calculates
19 to the power of his secret number (6) modulo 23
2

Alice calculates
8 to the power of her secret number (15) modulo 23
2

The key to be used for encryption is 2

In Reality

Usually the number is not 23

A prime number at least 600 digits long

There is no known solution to the discrete logarithm problem

The general theory is

Even if someone knows g^a, g^b and g^(a*b)

It is very hard to calculate a and b
