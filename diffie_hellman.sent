Encryption without shared secrets

Diffie-Hellman

We want to send encrypted messages

I decide to generate a random password

The password I generate is "cfzpz"

Alice does not know this password, so
    if I encrypt a message with this password
    and send it, Alice won't be able to understand it

I need to send Alice the password
Without Eva knowing it

Example 1

@wikipedia_diffie_hellman.png

#@box.png
#TODO

#@locker_lock.png
#TODO

Example 2

If I send you the box with my lock on it

You put your own lock on the box and send it back

I take my lock off, so now it only has your lock
    and send it back

You take your lock off and now you can open it

It was sent through the mail three times

Each time it had a lock on it

Eva can never open the box

Example 3

I convert each letter to it's number
a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, etc..

Password is now 3, 6, 26, 16, 26

m = 3

I generate a very large random number and don't tell anyone what it is

This large random number is a

I multiply the message by the number to get m*a

I send Alice this number

Alice generates a very large random number (b) and doesn't tell anyone what it is

Alice multiplies what I sent her by b and sends it back

m*a*b

I divide what she sends me by my number, a, to get m*b

I send back the result of that, m*b

Alice divides what I sent her by her number (b) to get m

Alice now knows m is 3

Repeat for the rest of the leters in the encryptopn key

Don't do that

This is very insecure

Eva knows what m*a, m*b and m*a*b are

Eva can compute (m*a)(m*b)/(m*a*b) to get m.

In the real world, this isn't used

Example 4

# TODO insert real method from wikipedia using modulo here
