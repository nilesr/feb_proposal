Algorithms

What is an algorithm

Two important ideas

1. Instructions

2. Repetition

How would you count everybody in this room

i = 0
Starting at the left
Go from left to right
Each time you see a person
i = i + 1

What's another way to do it?

i = 0
Have everybody stand up
Begin
Make half the room sit down
i = i + 1
If there is only one person standing up, end

After we've ended, the number of people in the room is two to the power of i
