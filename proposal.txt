Algorithms
Day 1
15 minutes -> KTANE
15 minutes -> groups with paper cards, one person has a hash map (letter -> number), other person has set of letters, letters must be ordered by number
5 minutes -> Share most efficent ways
15 minutes -> Slides on the various sorting algorithms
6 minutes -> 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes
15 minutes -> Brainstorm compression algorithms
10 minutes -> Slides on compression algorithms
5 minutes -> Slides on hashing algorithms
15 minutes -> Brainstorm encryption with shared secrets
15 minutes -> Slides on encryption with shared secrets i.e. CRAM
5 minutes -> Brainstorm on encryption without shared secrets
10 minutes -> Slides on encryption without shared secrets i.e. Diffie-Hellman

Day 2
5 mins -> Seeing mazes
5 mins -> Blind mazes
5 mins -> Slides on Lee's algorithm
5 mins -> Slides on Djaikstra's algorithm
15 mins -> Adding algorithm video
