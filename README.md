# Febuary Proposal
This repository contains images, sent slides and ~~videos~~ for use with a class I am teaching on Febuary 2nd and 3rd to other students at HB Woodlawn.

## Required tools
- A video player, such as MPV
- Suckless [sent](http://tools.suckless.org/sent/)

## The videos used in this project are:
- [See how computers add numbers in one lesson](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VBDoT8o4q00)
- [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg)

# Update as of June 2nd, 2016

This git repository has been abandoned after I finished teaching the class. If you have any questions, please open a github issue and I'll be happy to respond
