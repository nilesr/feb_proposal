Lee's Algorithm

Solves mazes when you can see the whole map

Step 1

Start at the end

For each adjacent square
write a 1

For each of those
find an adjacent unmarked square
Mark that 2

Continue until a square adjecent to the maze start is marked

Begin the maze
Always move to the lower numbered square
